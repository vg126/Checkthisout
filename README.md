Just check out whatever is here. That will explain itself. Wait for me (VG) to  explain the context.

## Configuration

Default settings are centralized in `config/appConfig.js`:

- `defaultBotState` – baseline state assigned to each bot instance.
- `defaultDropdownState` – initial model selections for bot 1 and bot 2.
- `multimodalModels` – mapping of available multimodal models grouped by provider and series.

Modify these fields to update default behaviour without editing the main script.
